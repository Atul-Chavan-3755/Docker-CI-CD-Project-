## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates the implementation of a complete Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes to ensure faster, reliable, and consistent software delivery.

### 📌 Project Overview
The CI/CD workflow is designed to trigger automatically on code changes pushed to the repository. It validates the application, runs automated tests, builds the artifact, and deploys the application to the target environment.

### ⚙️ Key Features
- Automated workflow triggered on push and pull requests
- Continuous Integration with build and test stages
- Continuous Deployment to target environment
- YAML-based workflow configuration
- Faster and consistent release process
- Reduced manual intervention

### 🧰 Technologies Used
- GitHub Actions  
- GitHub Workflows (YAML)  
- Docker (optional, if used)  
- Linux Runner Environment  
- Cloud/Server deployment (AWS/VM if applicable)

### 🔄 Pipeline Stages
1. **Code Checkout** – Fetch latest source code  
2. **Build** – Compile or package the application  
3. **Test** – Run automated test cases  
4. **Artifact Creation** – Prepare deployable build  
5. **Deploy** – Release application to target server  

### 🎯 Objectives
- Automate software delivery lifecycle  
- Improve code quality with automated testing  
- Enable faster and reliable deployments  
- Follow DevOps best practices  

### 📈 Benefits
- Zero-touch deployments  
- Faster feedback loop  
- Improved developer productivity  
- Consistent build environment  
- Easy rollback capability  

### 🚦 How It Works
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub repository.
2. GitHub Actions workflow triggers automatically.
3. The pipeline builds and tests the application.
4. On success, the application is deployed automatically.
